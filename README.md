# Deep-Autoencoder-using-Tensorflow

## Getting Started
This is an implementation of an stacked autoencoder using Tensorflow to reconstruct a subset of samples from the mnist dataset.The architecture is built using tensorflow's layers API. 

## Requirements
* Python 3.5 or above
* Tensorflow 1.6 or above
* Numpy
* Matplotlib

## Dataset 
The code downloads the mnnist dataset automatically if it does not exist on your local machine. Alternatively, download the four zip fles and place them in a directory and name it according to the code.

## Running the model
Install the required libraries and run this file
```
python Stacked-AutoEncoder.py
```

## Results
